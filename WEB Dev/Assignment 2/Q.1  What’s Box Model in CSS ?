Q.1 Whatâ€™s Box Model in CSS ? 
Solution:
The Box Model is a fundamental concept in CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) that describes the layout and sizing of elements on a webpage. It defines how the content, padding, border, and margin of an element are calculated and displayed.

The Box Model consists of four main components:

1. Content: This represents the actual content of the element, such as text, images, or other nested elements. It is enclosed by the padding, border, and margin.

2. Padding: The padding is the space between the content and the element's border. It provides internal spacing and is specified using the `padding` property. Padding can be set individually for each side (top, right, bottom, left) or using shorthand notation.

3. Border: The border is a line that surrounds the padding and content of an element. It is specified using the `border` property and can have different styles, colors, and widths.

4. Margin: The margin is the space outside the border, creating separation between elements. It is specified using the `margin` property and can be set individually for each side or using shorthand notation.

Together, these components form a rectangular box around an element, defining its size and spacing within the document flow.

The Box Model is crucial for understanding how elements are displayed and how their dimensions are calculated. It allows for precise control over the layout and spacing of elements on a webpage. By adjusting the content, padding, border, and margin properties, developers can create visually appealing and well-structured layouts.
